This repository presents a 5-stage pipeline CPU, developed based on *[D. Harris and S. Harris, "Digital Design and Computer Architecture (2nd Edition)."](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123944245/digital-design-and-computer-architecture)*. The CPU design follows the schematic outlined in the book, with the addition of a branch target buffer (BTB) predictor module.

For **HIT CS students**, please note that this CPU is compatible with Lab 1 and Lab 2 **only if** the test environment file `soc_top.v: line 538` is modified to enable asynchronous reading of instruction and data memory. I believe this modification is both necessary and practical.
